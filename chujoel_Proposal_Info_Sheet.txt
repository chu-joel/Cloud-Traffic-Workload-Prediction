ABSTRACT-BEGIN:
The aim of this project is to accurately predict cloud workload using a trans-
former model. Doing this will allow cloud service providers to accurately de-
termine the amount of resources to allocate at any given time. Thus preventing
under and over provisioning of resources. The datasets google cluster trace and
Alibaba trace will both be used as training, testing and validating datasets. The
transformer model will be compared to other time series workload prediction
models such as LSTM. This project is successful if the transformer model has a
greater prediction accuracy than traditional models. A decrease in prediction
and training will be a bonus.
